               <h2>The Start</h2>
               <p>
                  For a lot of writers, when they come up with a story, it starts with a small idea and from there they expand it and add more to it. <b>But that wasn't the same for me.</b> The way my story came about was through a vivid dream. When I was in high school, I had a vivid dream, one like I've never had before, and I was always writing, so when I woke up I decided to make it a story because it was so crazy. While the dream has gone through quite a few changes, it's still the same storyline as my dream.

               <h2>Step 1: Characters</h2>
               <div class="funParagraph">
                  <p id="testP">The first step I went through was making characters. They've only changed a little bit over time. The way I went about making my characters is by searching for names that mean what I want the to portray. For example. my main character's name is Lexi which means <q>defender of man</q>. <small>Spoiler for the book.</small> That's what she is going to be as the progresses. After getting the names down for my main human characters, I walk through my animal characters.</p>
                  <p id="Crystal">Crystal</p>
                  <p>One animal being Crstyal, a snowy owl. For any animal characters, I find pictures to go along with them, mostly for my own reference. Crystal is the only one I was able to draw myself. After knowing all the character names, I work through they personalities, appearances, fears, backgrounds, and more.</p>

               <h2>Step 2: Map</h2>
               <p>
                  The next step I take is making a layout of the world. When I used to write little stories, I would just have a basic stick drawing of where everything was located. That was until I found <a href="https://inkarnate.com/">Inkarnate</a>. I only did a simple, little map that would help guide me in writing and possible be a map for readers, but I'm still undecided if I should even publish it, let alone use this map in it.

               <h2>Step 3: Events Timeline</h2>
               <p>
                  This step could very well be the second hardest in the story making process. The first, for most at least, is creating a character and working on their entire personlity and background. For me, this was probably the easiest step. Since the story was created from a dream that I had, I already knew every big event that was going to happen. It was a little difficult to come up with filler for in between those event, but it was still fairly easy compared to creating the characters. It was even easier than making the map. I know that this isn't how others come up with their events for a story, but it was for me.

               <h2>Step 4: Writing Draft(s)</h2>
               <p>
                  This step can be easy or hard depending on how many big and small events you have thought out. Since I had a storyline all planned out, this step was rather easy for me. I've only done one draft and the draft I'm working on now is already very different than what it was before. It's hard for me to say if this will be my onlly other draft or if I will do more after I finish this draft.

               <h2>Final Step: Final Draft</h2>
               <p>
                  This is probably the easiest step. All you really have to do is look back and make any grammer changes that you need to or any other changes. Then, just put it all together to make your book. It might be a little bit of a process to get it published or self publish, but I haven't looked into it, yet. I'm not sure if it will be something that share or not. Once you've complete this, you've crossed the finish line.
