               <h2>The Start</h2>
               <p>
                  For a lot of writers, when they come up with a story, it starts with a small idea and from there they expand it and add more to it. <b>But that wasn't the same for me.</b> The way my story came about was through a vivid dream. When I was in high school, I had a vivid dream, one like I've never had before, and I was always writing, so when I woke up I decided to make it a story because it was so crazy. While the dream has gone through quite a few changes, it's still the same storyline as my dream.

               <h3>Step 1: Characters</h3>
               <p>
                  The first step I went through was making characters. They've only changed a little bit over time. The way I went about making my characters is by searching for names that mean what I want the to portray. For example. my main character's name is Lexi which means <q>defender of man</q>. <small>Spoiler for the book.</small> That's what she is going to be as the progresses. After getting the names down for my main human characters, I walk through my animal characters. One animal being Crstyal, a snowy owl. For any animal characters, I find pictures to go along with them, mostly for my own reference. Crystal is the only one I was able to draw myself. After knowing all the character names, I work through they personalities, appearances, fears, backgrounds, and more.

               <h4>Step 2: Map</h4>
               <p>
                  The next step I take is making a layout of the world. When I used to write little stories, I would just have a basic stick drawing of where everything was located. That was until I found <a href="https://inkarnate.com/">Inkarnate</a>. I only did a simple, little map that would help guide me in writing and possible be a map for readers, but I'm still undecided if I should even publish it, let alone use this map in it.
