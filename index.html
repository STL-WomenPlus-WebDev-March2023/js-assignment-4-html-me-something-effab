                  For a lot of writers, when they come up with a story, it starts with a small idea and from there they expand it and add more to it. <b>But that wasn't the same for me.</b> The way my story came about was through a vivid dream. When I was in high school, I had a vivid dream, one like I've never had before, and I was always writing, so when I woke up I decided to make it a story because it was so crazy. While the dream has gone through quite a few changes, it's still the same storyline as my dream.
